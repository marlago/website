### About

I study sentence comprehension in native and non-native speakers across different languages. My goal is to figure out how humans represent and use grammatical knowledge, and how their knowledge changes when they are exposed to a new language. I use eye-tracking, neurophysiological and cross-linguistic evidence with the goal of building cognitive models of the representations and processes that underlie real-time language processing in multilingual speakers.
