blurb: >
	In 2017 I received a grant from the German Research Foundation [(DFG)](http://www.dfg.de/en/) to study how Spanish and English native speakers process gender and number agreement in German. I am using this research as a test case to address two important questions: *Are some languages more difficult to understand and potentially learn than others? And can this difficulty lie in how a speaker's native language shapes their processing mechanisms?* This work is being conducted at the University of Potsdam in collaboration with [Kate Stone](https://stonekate.github.io/) and [Shravan Vasishth](https://vasishth.github.io/).
