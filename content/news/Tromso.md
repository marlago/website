title: Eye-tracking workshop
date: 2017-10-09
blurb: >
	During 9-11 October 2017, Akira Omaki and me went to Tromso to co-teach a course on reading and visual-world eye-tracking methods. Students learned and gained practical expertise in the running of eye-tracking experiments, and by the end of the course submitted proposals to design their own eye-tracking studies [[link]](https://site.uit.no/acqva/lingphil-course-in-eye-tracking-at-uit-october-9-11/)
